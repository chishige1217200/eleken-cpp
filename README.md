This is monitoring program using outlet.
# How to use
1. Before you start monitoring program, you have to put a plug into the outlet, because this program checks power status to monitor PC.
2. After starting program, program checks power status that PC is plugged or unplugged.
3. The moment PC is unplugged, this program alerts by sound.

I think this is electric KENSINGTON LOCK using outlet.
I imagine this program will be used in silent place like library.
When PC will be stolen by someone, the criminal must unplug first.
Then, PC sounds alert, people near PC percieve absconding.

**Attention**
I don't guarantee PC's safety!!
You have to use this program on your own responsibility.
